## 核显战未来

你希望能在轻薄本上畅玩游戏吗，希望以后的笔记本可以去掉独显吗，希望个人电脑价格大幅降低吗？

### 项目概要

本项目旨在设计和提供高性能的集成图形处理单元(iGPU)IP核，服务于各类处理器设计公司，以满足未来高分辨率、高帧率游戏需求。我们计划在未来几年内，通过与国内外CPU制造商合作，逐步占领游戏显卡市场，使核显成为主流市场的标配，从而在激烈的竞争中抢占先机。

### 团队

我们将组建二十人左右的设计团队，覆盖整个IP从设计到固化的过程。

### Market

Our Market is constantly growing since the first trip back in 2020. By 2048 the need of our product became clear, with more than 1.000.000 customers traveling around the universe.

#### a. Geotargeting

More than half of space travelers are Africans with ~50% of them being Malawians. According to the African Space Institution, the average African citizen spends more than 100k drachmas per year for travel, with more than 50% of this amount going to space traveling. Later on, Latin American and Chinese markets will also be targeted.

##### Expansion Map

#### b. Competition

|         | Comfort | Security | Price | Total |
| ------- | :-----: | :------: | :---: | :---: |
| Dummy-D |    5    |    5    |   3   |  13  |
| Space-X |    4    |    5    |   4   |  13  |
| Laika   |    3    |    5    |   5   |  13  |

On one hand Dummy-D outperforms competitive players by being far more comforting. On the other hand, ticket price is higher than the market average as relaxation services addition results to higher production costs. As the totals reveal, we enter the market offering an equivalent to traditional market leaders product.

### Product

Dummy-D is currently in version 0.9-Sofa. Jacuzzi feature is in the building and will be introduced in version 1.0. The maximum capacity of our aircraft is 75 travelers/journey.
